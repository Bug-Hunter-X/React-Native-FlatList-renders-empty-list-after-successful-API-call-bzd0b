# React Native FlatList Empty List Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Native where a FlatList component renders an empty list even after successfully fetching data from an API. The `MyComponent` fetches data, handles loading and error states, but fails to display the fetched data in the FlatList.

## Bug Description

The app fetches data from an API and updates the state correctly, however, the FlatList remains empty.  The loading indicator disappears, indicating data has been fetched, but no items are displayed. This problem could be caused by incorrect data handling or improper key extraction in the FlatList.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios`.
4. Observe the empty FlatList after the loading indicator disappears.

## Solution

The solution involves using a unique key for each item in the FlatList's `keyExtractor` prop. The initial code uses index as a key which can lead to issues when data changes.  A unique identifier from the fetched data should be used instead. Please refer to `bugSolution.js` for a complete solution.
